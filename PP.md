# Pair programming 

## Describe your experience working in a pair programming environment.

My previous companies donâ€™t really use pair programming, but I had experiences in college with teammates. And I believe pair programming can have several benefits, including improved code quality, knowledge sharing, reduced development time, and Increased collaboration. However, there are also challenges in communication and distraction when working remotely.
