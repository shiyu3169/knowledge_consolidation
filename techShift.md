# Tech Stack Shifting

## Discuss an instance where you opted for a different language, framework, dependency, etc., in your project. What was it, and what were the pros and cons of that switch? Examples here could be shifting frameworks like moving from React to Vue, opting for a different dependency like moving from fetch to axios, or rebuilding a service that was once in Java and will now be in Go.

When I was hired ProGuides a few years ago, I helped migrate their frontend code from PHP based to Vue.js. I believe Switching technologies can have both benefits and drawbacks, and it's important to carefully consider the specific context and requirements of a project before making a switch. So we made a list:

Advantages:
1. Improved user experience: Vue.js is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, and it can offer a more dynamic and interactive experience for the end-user compared to a traditional PHP-based application.
2. Better performance: Vue.js is known for its lightweight and fast performance, which can improve the overall speed and responsiveness of the application.
3. Vibrant community: Vue.js has a large and active community, which can provide support and resources for development.
Improved maintainability: Vue.js uses a component-based architecture, which can make the code easier to understand and maintain.

Disadvantages:
1. Learning curve &Limited experience: The team would need to invest time in learning Vue.js, which could slow down the development process.
2. Backend integration: The team may need to make changes to the backend to integrate it with the new Vue.js-based frontend, which could add complexity and effort to the project.
3. Incompatible libraries: PHP has a large ecosystem of libraries and tools, and some of these may not be compatible with Vue.js, which could limit the options available to the team.

Fortunately, many engineers at ProGuides had experiences with Vue.js (and that’s one of the main reasons that we didn’t pick React). And in order to not influence the development speed too much, this becomes a continuous long-term project that we do step by step. 

Overall, The pros and cons of switching should be weighed against the current solution to determine if the switch is worth the effort and resources required to make it happen.
