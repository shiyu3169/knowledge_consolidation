# Merge Sort

## Works by continually dividing the list in half until only two sublists of one item remain. Then we merge (and compare) items in each sublist until we have sorted the entire list. This also uses a divide and conquer approach.

### Time Complexity
O(n log n) time on average, and O(n log n) in worst case

### Space Complexity
O(n) space - used in the merge step
