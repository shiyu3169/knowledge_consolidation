# Sorting

## What are the time and space complexity for sorting algorithms

### Time and space complexity is a measurement of how a given algorithm performs as you increase the size of the input. Time Complexity measures how long an algorithm runs in relation to the input, where as Space Complexity measures how much memory the algorithm will occupy. Many algorithms make a tradeoff between time & space. Some popular sorting algorithms include Merge Sort, Quick sort, Bubble Sort and Radix Sort.
