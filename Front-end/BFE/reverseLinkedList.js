/* Another basic algorithm even for Front End developers.

You are asked to reverse a linked list.

Suppose we have Node interface like this

class Node {
   new(val: number, next: Node);
   val: number
   next: Node
}
We can then chain nodes together to create a linked list.

const Three = new Node(3, null)
const Two = new Node(2, Three)
const One = new Node(1, Two)

//now we have  a linked list
// 1 → 2 → 3
Now how can you reverse it to 3 → 2 → 1 ? you can modify the next property of each node, but not the val.

Could you solve it with and without recursion? */
