/* This is a follow-up on 57. create an Observable.

There are a lot of operators for Observable, if we think of Observable as event stream, then modifying the stream is a common task, transformation operators are useful at this.

In this problem, you are asked to implement map(), as the name indicates, it maps the value to another value thus creating a new event stream.

Here is an example.

const source = Observable.from([1,2,3])

map(x => x * x)(source) // this transformer doubles numbers and create a new stream
 .subscribe(console.log)
// 1
// 4
// 9
Observable has pipe() method which could make this more readable.

const source = Observable.from([1,2,3])

source.pipe(map(x => x * x))
 .subscribe(console.log)
// 1
// 4
// 9
Note Observable is already given for you, no need to create it. */

/**
 * @param {any} input
 * @return {(observable: Observable) => Observable}
 * returns a function which trasnform Observable
 */
function map(transform) {
  return (source) => {
    return new Observable((subscriber) => {
      const sub = source.subscribe((val) => {
        try {
          subscriber.next(transform(val))
        } catch (err) {
          subscriber.error(err)
          subscriber.complete()
          sub.unsubscribe()
        }
      })
      this.unsubscribe = () => {
        sub.unsubscribe()
      }
    })
  }
}
