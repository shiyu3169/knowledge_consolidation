`??=` is called the "nullish coalescing assignment operator" in JavaScript. It is used to assign a value to a variable only if the variable's current value is null or undefined.

The syntax for the nullish coalescing assignment operator is:

`variable ??= value`;
Here, variable is the variable to be assigned, and value is the value to assign to variable if it is null or undefined.

For example, consider the following code:
```
let myVariable = null;
myVariable ??= 'default value';

console.log(myVariable); // Output: 'default value'
```
In this code, myVariable is initially null, so the nullish coalescing operator assigns the value 'default value' to myVariable. As a result, the output of the console.log statement is 'default value'.

If myVariable had already had a non-nullish value, the nullish coalescing assignment operator would not have done anything:
```
let myVariable = 'existing value';
myVariable ??= 'default value';
```
console.log(myVariable); // Output: 'existing value'
In this case, myVariable already had a value ('existing value'), so the nullish coalescing operator did not assign the default value to it. As a result, the output of the console.log statement is 'existing value'.
