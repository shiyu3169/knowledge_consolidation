In JavaScript, a static method is a method that belongs to a class, rather than to an instance of the class. This means that you can call a static method on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class.

To define a static method in a JavaScript class, you can use the static keyword before the method name. Here is an example:

```
class MyClass {
  static myStaticMethod() {
    console.log('This is a static method.');
  }
}
```


MyClass.myStaticMethod(); // "This is a static method."
In this example, myStaticMethod is a static method of the MyClass class. You can call the method directly on the class itself, without creating an instance of the class. When you call MyClass.myStaticMethod(), the method is executed, and the message "This is a static method." is printed to the console.

Static methods can be useful for defining utility functions that are related to the class, but don't depend on specific instances of the class. They can also be used to enforce certain behavior or constraints on the class, such as preventing the creation of invalid instances.
