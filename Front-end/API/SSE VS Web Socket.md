Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSockets are both technologies used for transmitting real-time data between a server and a client. However, they have some differences:

Purpose: SSE is designed specifically for sending unidirectional data from the server to the client, while WebSockets allow for full-duplex communication between the server and the client, meaning both the server and the client can send and receive data simultaneously.

Message format: SSE only supports text-based data, while WebSockets support binary and text-based data.

Connection: SSE uses a long-lived HTTP connection, while WebSockets use a dedicated, full-duplex connection.

Compatibility: SSE is compatible with older browsers and works well with proxy servers, while WebSockets require support from the browser and the server and may not work well with some proxy servers.

Use cases: SSE is best suited for sending small amounts of real-time data from the server to the client, such as updates, notifications, and news feeds, while WebSockets are better for more complex applications that require real-time bidirectional communication, such as games, chat applications, and collaboration tools.

In summary, while both SSE and WebSockets are used for real-time communication, they have different strengths and weaknesses and should be chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.
