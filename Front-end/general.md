## Local Storage vs Cookie
Both local storage and cookies are methods of storing data in a client-side browser, but they have some differences.

Cookies are small text files stored in the browser and are sent back to the server with each HTTP request. They were originally designed to store small amounts of data (such as user preferences) and are still widely used for this purpose. However, because they are sent with each request, they can also be used to track a user's activity across multiple sites.

Local storage, on the other hand, is a more recent technology that allows you to store larger amounts of data in the browser, without having to send it back to the server with each request. This makes it faster and more efficient than cookies for storing larger amounts of data. Unlike cookies, local storage is not automatically sent to the server, which provides a higher level of security and privacy.

In summary, cookies are still useful for small amounts of data that need to be sent to the server with each request, while local storage is a more efficient way to store larger amounts of data that can be used to improve the user experience without having to send data to the server.
