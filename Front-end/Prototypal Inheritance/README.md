# Prototypes inheritance
In programming, we often want to take something and extend it.

For instance, we have a user object with its properties and methods, and want to make admin and guest as slightly modified variants of it. Weâ€™d like to reuse what we have in user, not copy/reimplement its methods, just build a new object on top of it.

Prototypal inheritance is a language feature that helps in that.
