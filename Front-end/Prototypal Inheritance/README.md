# Prototypes inheritance
In programming, we often want to take something and extend it.

For instance, we have a user object with its properties and methods, and want to make admin and guest as slightly modified variants of it. We’d like to reuse what we have in user, not copy/reimplement its methods, just build a new object on top of it.

Prototypal inheritance is a language feature that helps in that.
